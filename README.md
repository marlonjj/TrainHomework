# TrainHomework

Howdy partners!

This project is a test Firebase I created during the fourth week of my coding bootcamp with Trilogy at UC Berkeley Extension

The user will see all the different train schedules already inputted by myself and any other users thanks to linking our code with Firebase. By entering their own terms into the input boxes below the table, the user can create a new train schedule to add to the database.

This program was a fun way for us to practice and display our knowledge of Firebase and the moment.js library that was newly shown to us. I got a lot out of this experience from researching Firebase and moment because both tools have a lot of uses and well written documentation.

It is all created by yours truly, Marlon Jovez, with the inspiration of the program and our teacher, David Hallinan. Feel free to reach me for questions at emjovbusiness@gmail.com
